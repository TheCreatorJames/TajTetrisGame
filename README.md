# TajTetrisGame
A game that advanced our team to Nationals, second year in a row. Placed in top Ten.


### Uniqueness
This game featured an in-game drag and drop code editor, as well as an animation tool, as well as a Texture tool. You could design levels that you'd mix with Tetris.
Rather than having static textures, we used bezier curves that would be computed from the animation file. This was easily compressible and allowed us to fit a lot of animation into our game.
