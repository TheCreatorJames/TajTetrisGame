# TajTetrisGame

### Welcome
This was a project written for the second year I participated in the Software Engineering Team competition. You are given several months to develop a software project and a prompt to fulfill.

The prompt this year was a game similar to titles like Tetris or Dr. Mario. 

No libraries (except for rendering libraries) were allowed. We designed all the code you see here.

### Goal and Uniqueness Of This Project
This game featured an in-game drag and drop code editor, as well as an animation tool, as well as a Texture tool. You could design levels that you'd mix with Tetris.

Rather than having static textures, we used bezier curves that would be computed from the animation file. This was easily compressible and allowed us to fit a lot of animation into our game.
